## Prusa i3 MKS(3D Printer)

Prusa i3 uses 3D printing filament as feedstock to make parts. It is simple to use and consistently produced good-quality prints. Prusa i3 comes with a brand new SuperPINDA probe for improved first layer calibration, added high-quality Misumi bearings and various useful design tweaks to make the printer easier to assemble and maintain. This red-and-black printer measures 15 by 19.7 by 22 inches (HWD), excluding the spool and the spool holder, which sit atop the printer. It is considerably larger than the Original Prusa Mini, which measures 14.6 by 13 by 15 inches (HWD). The i3 MK3S also has a larger print volume, 9.8 by 8.3 by 7.9 inches, compared with the 7-by-7-by-7-inch print volume of the Prusa Mini.

## 300 RPM BO Motor-Straight 

The 300 RPM BO Motor Plastic Gear Motor â€“ BO series straight motor gives good torque and rpm at lower operating voltages, which is the biggest advantage of these motors.
Small shaft with matching wheels gives an optimized design for your application or robot. Mounting holes on the body & light weight makes it suitable for in-circuit placement. This motor can be used with 69mm Diameter Wheel for Plastic Gear Motors and 87mm Diameter Multipurpose Wheel for Plastic Gear Motors.

## L293D Motor Driver

The L293D Motor Driver/Servo Shield for Arduino is probably one of the most versatile on the market and features 2 servo and 4 motor connectors for DC or stepper motors.
This Arduino compatible motor Driver shield is a full-featured product that it can be used to drive 4 DC motor or two 4-wire steppers and two 5v servos. It drives the DC motor and stepper with the L293D, and it drives the servo with Arduino pin9 and pin10.
The shield contains two L293D motor drivers and one 74HC595 shift register. The shift register expands 3 pins of the Arduino to 8 pins to control the direction of the motor drivers. The output enables the L293D is directly connected to the PWM outputs of the Arduino.
